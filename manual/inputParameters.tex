\section{General parameters}

\param{general\_option}
{integer}
{1}
{Always}
{Determines the overall flow of program execution.\\

{\ttfamily general\_option} = 1: Compute the current potential for a range of $\lambda$.\\

{\ttfamily general\_option} = 2: Do not compute the current potential, but rather load the current potential computed
by \nescoil~in the file \parlink{nescout\_filename}, compute the $\chi^2_B$ and $\chi^2_K$ for it,
and save results. For this setting, \parlink{Nlambda} will be over-written with the number of
current potential solutions found in the nescout file.\\

{\ttfamily general\_option} = 3: Emulate \nescoil's truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) solver.
The least-squares problem solved will be minimization of only $\chi^2_B$ (i.e. $\lambda=0$.)
Output quantities will be saved in the same arrays as if $\lambda$ were scanned.
For this setting, \parlink{Nlambda} will be over-written with the number of
singular values.\\

{\ttfamily general\_option} = 4: Search for a value of the regularization weight such that
a certain target is met. The target is chosen using \parlink{target\_option}.
Use this value of {\ttfamily general\_option} for running \regcoil~inside
a fixed-boundary plasma shape optimization, in which case {\ttfamily chi2\_B\_target}
is the objective function you should minimize in the optimization.\\

{\ttfamily general\_option} = 5: Same as 4, except that before the $\lambda$ search is carried out,
the system is solved
for $\lambda=0$ and $\lambda=\infty$ to check whether the current density target is attainable.
Thus, this option takes a little more time than {\ttfamily general\_option}=4 but is more robust.

to be odd in $\theta$ and $\zeta$. This option corresponds to stellarator symmetry.\\

{\ttfamily symmetry\_option} = 2: Force the single-valued part of the current potential
to be even in $\theta$ and $\zeta$. I'm not sure why you would ever use this option,
but it is available for completeness.\\

{\ttfamily symmetry\_option} = 3: No symmetry in the current potential is imposed.

\param{save\_level}
{integer}

{`'}
{When \parlink{general\_option}=1 or 3 and \parlink{load\_bnorm}=\true.}

plasma surface associated with current inside the plasma.}

\myhrule

\param{net\_poloidal\_current\_Amperes}
{real}
{1.0}
{If \parlink{geometry\_option\_plasma}=0,1,or 5, i.e. if the plasma surface is not a vmec equilibrium.}
{The number of Amperes of current the links the coil winding surface poloidally,
denoted $G$ in \cite{regcoilPaper}. If the plasma surface is obtained from a vmec equilibrium,
then {\ttfamily net\_poloidal\_current\_Amperes} will be determined instead
from the {\ttfamily bvco} value in the vmec wout file.

is never read from a wout file.

\subsection{NLOPT Optimize}
The following objective function is used when \texttt{nlopt\_optimize} is called.
\begin{gather}
f = \texttt{nlopt\_optimize} \left( -\alpha_V V_{\text{coil}} + \alpha_S S_p - \alpha_D d_{\text{min}} + \alpha_B \chi^2_B + \alpha_K \norm{\bm{K}}_2 + \alpha_{\max K} \max{K} \right)
\end{gather}
Here $S_p$ is the spectral width,
\begin{gather}
S_p = \sum_{m,n} m^p \left( \left(r_{mn}^c\right)^2 + \left(z_{mn}^s\right)^2 \right),
\label{spectral_width}
\end{gather}
$d_{\text{min}}$ is the minimum coil-plasma distance,
\begin{gather}
d_{\text{min}} = \min \left( \sqrt{ \left(\bm{r}_{\text{coil}} - \bm{r}_{\text{plasma}} \right)^2 } \right),
\end{gather}
and $\norm{\bm{K}}_2$ is the root-mean-squared current density,
\begin{gather}
\norm{\bm{K}}_2 = \sqrt{\chi^2_K/A_{\text{coil}}}.
\end{gather}
The coefficients in $f$ are defined by the user.
